### Notes for my Simulation study on testing for species level modality patterns in phenology.
- Currently I use inaturalist data to infer the general trends, but its been brought to my attention that there is a well documented phenology data set out of the desert museum in AZ. Possibly refer to this and see if we can use this data?
